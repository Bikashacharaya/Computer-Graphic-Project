Cancer is a group of diseases involving abnormal cell growth with the potential to invade or spread to other parts of the body. Not all tumors are cancerous; benign tumors do not spread to other parts of the body Possible signs and symptoms include a lump, abnormal bleeding, prolonged cough, unexplained weight loss and a change in bowel movements. While these symptoms may indicate cancer, they may have other causes. Over 100 cancers affect humans.
	
 In this mini project we are demonstrating about cancer cells and its causes. We have shown from basic illustration of cancer to how it spreads, different  types  of cancer to its causes. It’s a 4 slide basic demonstration of cancer as a disease
In first frame we have showed how cancer is just a uncontrolled division of cells.  Cells divide and self destroy when its age is over. There is perfect balance between new born cells and old dying cells. But when it comes to cancer, they divide uncontrollably. This results in uneven shape and  not having a proper functionality. Large family of uneven  cells will harm the other body tissues and functioning of other organs surrounding it.
In second frame we have shown two main classification of cancer.
•	Malignant Tumor
•	Benign Tumor
In Malignant tumor are cancerous and are made up of cells that grow out of control. We have shown how cancer cells get into blood stream and spread to other parts of the body affecting other parts or other organs in the body.
In Benign Tumor it forms just one huge mass at a particular site. They do not spread or affect the neighboring cells.
In third frame is the extension of the second. We have demonstrated the malignant tumor getting into blood stream and developing cancer in other part of the body. 
In last frame we have shown the causes of cancer. External factors like alcohol, cigarette, exposure to sun, and exposure to asbestos and radioactive material.
